Sleep and At-Risk Health Behaviors among Adolescents 

The aim of the project was to design and create a mechatronic system that coverts the Hungry 
Hungry Hippos game to a robotic game. The project involved creating an autonomous car that 
carries a hippo facsimile, a vision system, and a collection system. The system was designed in 
such a way that it is best operated by people with an interest in STEM, computer vision, or simply 
like autonomous systems. We suggest that operation is done by anyone twelve years or older 
with access to a computer due to the occasional setup requirements. This product would also be 
a great teaching tool for teachers trying to introduce students into vision systems or programing.
